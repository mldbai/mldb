## Getting Help with MLDB & Contributing to MLDB

Bug reports and requests for help with installing, running or using the MLDB 
Community Edition are very welcome, and the preferred mechanism for this is to 
[create a Github Issue](https://github.com/mldbai/mldb/issues/new) and a member
of the MLDB team will do their best to respond within a couple of business days.

To ensure a prompt and helpful reply, please try to include the following 
information in your Issue text:

* How are you running MLDB? Docker, OVA, AMI? Did you build your own Docker image?
* What hardware/operating system are you using? Which version of Ubuntu, how many
cores, how much RAM?
* What are you trying to do, what happened, and what would you have expected to 
have happened instead?

MLDB is being actively developed by [MLDB.ai](http://mldb.ai) and does 
not have a public roadmap at the moment. If you would like to contribute code or 
new features to MLDB, the best first step would be to send an email to 
info@mldb.ai to discuss how this might fit into existing development plans.
