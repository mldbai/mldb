# - Add only direct dependencies that are required to *build and run the tests*.
#   pydata packages should be added to python_requirement_mldb_base.txt instead
# - Put version of direct dependencies here, however keep in mind that versions
#   from the constraints files have precedence over the requirements file.
# - Keeping a comment for weird deps would be nice.
# - Requirements that only work on a single platform (like prctl) should be in
#   requirements-$(OSNAME).txt instead of this file; it's only for common
#   requirements across all platforms.
