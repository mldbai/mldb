MLDB is an open-source database designed for machine learning. 
You can install it wherever you want and send it commands over a RESTful API to 
store data, explore it using SQL, then train machine learning models and expose them as APIs. More information is available at http://mldb.ai

This repository contains the source code for MLDB, which can be used to [build the MLDB Community Edition](Building.md), which is a Docker image containing all of MLDB's dependencies and can be run anywhere.

**The easiest way to get started with MLDB** is to [sign up to MLDB.ai](https://mldb.ai/#signup) and launch a free 90-minute hosted MLDB session. You'll be able to browse the live documentation and run and modify the demos yourself. You can also download a pre-built binary of the [MLDB Enterprise Edition](http://mldb.ai/doc/#builtin/Running.md.html) and use it with a free trial license for non-commercial purposes, which can be obtained instantly once you [sign up to MLDB.ai](https://mldb.ai/#signup).

Please [create a Github Issue](https://github.com/mldbai/mldb/issues/new) or [chat with us on Gitter](https://gitter.im/mldbai/mldb) if you have any questions or encounter problems while building or running MLDB.
