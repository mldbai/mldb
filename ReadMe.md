# MLDB is the Machine Learning Database
### by [Datacratic](http://datacratic.com/)

MLDB is a new kind of database, one that is specifically designed for operationalizing machine learning. You install it wherever you want and send it commands over a RESTful API to store and explore data, train machine learning models on that data, and then expose those models as APIs. More information is available at http://mldb.ai

This repository contains the source code for MLDB, which can be used to [build the MLDB Community Edition](Building.md), which is a Docker image that makes it easy to get started with MLDB.

Please [create a Github Issue](https://github.com/mldbai/mldb/issues/new) if you have any questions or encounter problems while building or running MLDB.
