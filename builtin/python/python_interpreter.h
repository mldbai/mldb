/** Thread state/GIL functions

    Please note that there is no way to manage the GIL and the thread
    state separately.  In MLDB, either a function is within a given
    thread state AND holds the GIL, or neither is true.  It's also not
    currently possible to recursively enter a thread state, though that
    would be possible to implement.

    The reason for these strict invariants is that the locking in Python
    is extremely difficult to get right: the GIL must be acquired
    *before* switching thread state, but will throw an assertion if
    there is no thread state active.

    This is necessary for re-entrancy of code that expects to acquire
    the GIL from a context where the GIL is already held.  It's primarily
    used in the destructor of objects that may be garbage collected by
    Python; not using it will cause a deadlock when the destructors
    attempt to acquire the GIL to do their work.

    The other way to get a token is to of course call enter() on a thread.

/** A note on object destruction and thread state.
    
    There are several objects defined here that encapsulate Python
    functionality.  Those which require an EnterThreadToken to
    be called must be called from within the context of a thread; the
    parameter enforces that contract.

    The destructors of these objects must all be called *without* a
    thread state active or the GIL held; they will enter into a thread
    state to do their job.  The only exception is for objects with a
    destroy() method; those objects may be destroyed with a thread state
    active without deadlocking if and only if the destroy() method is
    called without a thread state active immediately before the destructor
    is called.

    These rules are complex, but are the only way that it's possible to
    guarantee cleanup in the context of the Python garbage collector
    for objects that may be co-owned by the Python runtime and MLDB.
