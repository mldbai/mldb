# Stemmer Function

A function of this types creates a stemmer that can be used on column names.

It is a wrapper around the Snowball open-source stemming library.
For more information about Snowball: <http://snowball.tartarus.org/index.php>

## Configuration

![](%%config function stemmer)

The following values are valid for the `language` configuration field: danish, dutch,
english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, porter, portuguese,
romanian, russian, spanish, swedish, turkish.

More information about the stemming
algorithms is available on the 
[Snowball page](http://snowball.tartarus.org/texts/stemmersoverview.html).

## Input and Output Values

Functions of this type have a single input value named `words` which is a row, and 
a single output value also named `words`.

## Example

After having created the following stemmer:

```
PUT /v1/functions/my_stemmer
{
    "type": "stemmer",
    "params": {
        "language": "english"
    }
}
```

and this dataset:

| *rowName* | *potato* | *potatoes* | *carrot* | *carrots* |
|-----------|----------|------------|----------|-----------|
|   row_0   |     1    |      2     |     3    |    None   |
|   row_1   | 'crips'  |  'chips'   |     0    | 'hi mom'  |


The following query will merge the stemmed columns, summing their content:

```
SELECT my_stemmer({words:{*}})[words] as * FROM our_dataset
```

and return:


| *rowName* | *potato* | *carrot* |
|-----------|----------|----------|
|   row_0   |     3    |     3    |
|   row_1   |     2    |     1    |


Note that strings are coerced to the integer value 1.


We can also nicely use it in conjunction with the tokenize function:

```
SELECT my_stemmer({words: {tokenize('I have liked having carrots', {splitchars:' '}) as *}}) as *
```

This returns:

|*words.I*|*words.carrot*|*words.have*|*words.like*|
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|
|    1    |     1        |     2      |      1     |


# Stemmer on documents Function

A function of this types creates a stemmer that can be used on whole strings.
It works in a way similar to the Stemmer Function above and has the same configuration, but
the input and output format are different. It will treat words separated by spaces.

## Input and Output Values

Functions of this type have a single input value named `document` which is a string, and 
a single output value named `stemmed document`.

## Example

After having created the following stemmer:

```
PUT /v1/functions/my_stemmer
{
    "type": "stemmerdoc",
    "params": {
        "language": "english"
    }
}
```

we can apply the stemming algorithm on the provided string:

`SELECT my_stemmer({document: 'I like having carrots'})`

This returns:

"I like have carrot"
