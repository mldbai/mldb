# Input Query Specifications

When a procedure accepts data as input, the data query can be specified in one of two ways: as a string or as a JSON object.

## As a String

Input queries can be specified as a string containing a full [SQL query](../sql/Sql.md). For example the string:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM dataset1 WHERE column1 > column2 ORDER BY column1
```

where `column1` and `column2` refer to columns in a pre-existing dataset with id `dataset1`.


## As a JSON Object

Input queries can also be specified as a JSON object representing a [Dataset Configuration](../datasets/DatasetConfig.md) and a decomposed [SQL query](../sql/Sql.md).

The fields in the JSON structure are as follows:

![](%%type MLDB::SelectStatement)

For example the object:

```python
{
  "select" : "column1, column2",
  "from" : {
    "id" : "dataset1"
  },
  "where" : "column1 > column2",
  "orderBy" : "column1"
}
```

is equivalent to the query above on the pre-existing dataset with id `dataset1`.  In addition, this representation
offers the ability to first create a dataset.  In this example,

```python
{
  "select" : "column1, column2",
  "from" : {
    "id" : "dataset1",
    "type" : "beh",
    "params" : {
        "dataFileUrl" : "file:///mldb_data/file.beh"
      }
  },
  "where" : "column1 > column2",
  "orderBy" : "column1"
}
```

the dataset `dataset1` is first created by loading a beh file.

## Limitations

For performance reason, some procedures do not accept a full SQL query as their data input.  For details on what
is supported for a given procedure, read its documentation.
