# Create Entity Procedure

The `createEntity` procedure type can create other entities as a procedure
step.  This is useful when views or similar need to be created as part
of a procedure running.

The createEntity procedure type can create all kinds of entities: procedures,
functions, datasets and plugins.

## Execution

When run, the procedure will have the same effect as a `POST` of the given
object to `/v1/<kind>s` endpoint.

## Errors

In the case of an error, the run will indicate that the step had an error.

## Configuration

![](%%config procedure createEntity)

## Output

The procedure's output will be in the following form, which allows for the
expanded configuration and the ID of the new entity to be obtained by the
caller:

![](%%type MLDB::CreateEntityProcedureOutput)
