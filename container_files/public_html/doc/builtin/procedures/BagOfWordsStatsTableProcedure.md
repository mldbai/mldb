# Bag Of Words Stats Table Procedure

This procedure type is meant to work with bags of words, as returned by the
`tokenize` function. It creates a statistical table to track the co-occurrence of each
word with the specified outcome, over all rows in a table.

It is related to the ![](%%doclink statsTable.train procedure) but is different in the
sense that the `statsTable.train` procedure is meant to operate on a dense dataset composed of a
fixed number of columns where each column will have its own stats table. This procedure 
treats columns as words in a document and trains a single stats table for all words.

The resulting statistical table can be persisted using the `statsTableFileUrl` parameter
and used later on to lookup counts using the ![](%%doclink statsTable.bagOfWords.posneg function).

## Configuration

![](%%config procedure statsTable.bagOfWords.train)

## Example

Suppose we have the following dataset called `text_dataset`:

|  rowName   |  text  |  label  |
|-------------|---|---|
| a     | i like apples  | 1 |
| b     | i like juice |
| c     | what about bananas? | 
| d     | apples are red | 1 |
| e     | bananas are yellow |
| f     | oranges are ... orange | 

If we run the following procedure:

```python
mldb.put("/v1/procedures/my_st", {
    "type": "statsTable.bagOfWords.train",
    "params": {
        "trainingData": "SELECT tokenize(text, {splitChars: ' '}) as * FROM text_dataset",
        "outcomes": [["label", "label IS NOT NULL"]],
        "statsTableFileUrl": "file://my_st.st"
    }
})
```

Below are some examples of the values in the resulting stats table:

| word | P(label) |
|--------|-------------------|
| apples | 1 |
| are | 0.333 |
| i | 0.5 |
| oranges | 0 |
