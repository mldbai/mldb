    If a filter_istream is passed, the code is optimized as it allows
    for the file to be memory mapped.  It should in that case be opened
    with the "mapped" option.

    The startBlock and endBlock functions are called, in the context of
    the processing thread, at the beginning and end of the block
    respectively.

    This is the fastest way to parse a text file.
