["This was one of the rare Amazon.com recommendations that actually paid off - it popped into my recommendation list after reading Starship Troopers.  They share the same genre and begin on a similar premise - in the near future, the main character is passively swept into a large conflict beyond their control.  But they are every different books, and I enjoyed The Forever War far more than Starship Troopers.In a way The Forever War is two books in one.  In the first you are introduced to the gritty details of a space war in Haldeman's version of the near future.  I enjoyed the descriptions of the perils of battles on other planets, how something as simple as falling over in a space suit could be fatal.  If the whole book followed this course it would be interesting but pretty forgettable.  But that's when you get to what I would consider the 'second book' - coming home.It's in the coming home that this book becomes a classic and, in my opinion, should be much more widely read.  It's not the only novel to explore the implications of near-lightspeed travel but Haldeman does this masterfully.  You watch as the protagonists attempt to cope with a world that has changed enough to become uncomfortable, then changes more and more as time continues to speed by them.This dynamic sets this book very much apart from Heinlein's Starship Troopers.  To some extent Troopers felt like a soapbox upon which Heinlein could lecture the reader about how he thought the world should be run.  Not so Haldeman - his versions of the future are crafted to seems slightly more and more alien, rather than something to aspire to or even something to warn against.  His characters do not blindly follow the rhetoric the way Heinlein's do - rather they simply do what they can to cope with the situation they're continually thrown into, coping with the strangeness.The clear difference between the 'two books' could have left this novel quite disjointed, but the writing style is fluid and you genuinely feel for the protagonist.  You follow him on this journey, experiencing the disjoint with him, and hoping he comes through it in the end.If this book comes up in your recommendations, do read it.  It is a gem well worth reading."]
