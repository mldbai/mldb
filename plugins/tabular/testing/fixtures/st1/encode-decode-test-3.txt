["This was my fourth \"Body Farm\" novel and I find that each one is more enjoyable than the last. Obviously, I am not reading them in order but that doesn't seem to matter. Anyone who is interested in well-developed characters, forensic science and a gripping plot should enjoy the \"Body Farm\" books. Except perhaps the embarrassing number of young earth creationists in our midst in the USA - they seem to be the only ones consistently giving these books bad reviews. I guess scientific fact is inconvenient to them and they choose to attack any messenger who points these facts out to them as evil liberals. Perhaps someone could direct them to the drivel otherwise known as \"The Left Behind\" books. To anyone else, I would highly recommend."]
