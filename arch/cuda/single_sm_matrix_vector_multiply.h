/** Given a matrix[ni][no] with stride stride, multiply by the vector[ni] and
    overwrite the vector[no] with the output.  The size of the vector should
    be at least max(no, ni).  Splits the work over the given number of
    threads.  Works best if the vector is in shared memory; global memory will
    be slow.

    It always goes through the matrix in such a way that the unit stride is
    respected.

       a certain o value and a certain subset of the i values, and then
       accumulate the updates, broadcasting them at the end.
       
       For example:
       32 threads
       2 outputs
       
       So we have 16 threads working on each example
       
       100 threads
       16 outputs
       
       So we have 7 threads on the first 4 examples, and 6 threads on
       the rest.
    
       32 threads
       100 outputs

       So most threads do 3 examples but the first 4 do 4.
