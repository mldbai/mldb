    The mapping argument, if non null, will initialize the vector with a
    vector that gives, for each example in the original dataset, the example
    number that it corresponds to in the new dataset.
    
    Note that this is an expensive function to call, as it requires that
    the data be completely reindexed.  It is better to call this before
    the finish() function is called, as otherwise that work will be
    wasted.
