    /* Bucketing algorithm.

       This code deals with the creation of "buckets" in the training
       data.  There are two purposes of buckets:

       1.  They reduce the tendancy to overfit.  Without buckets, a
           real variable over a 100,000 example dataset could have
           100,000 different values.  Each of these gets tested
           individually, leading to a propensity to fine-tune the
           split values very closely (which can lead to overfitting).
           With buckets, these 100,000 values will be put into 1000
           (or another number of) buckets, and only 1000 split points
           will be tested.  As these split points are pre-computed,
           they will not be optimised to the point of overfitting.  Small
           improvements in accuracy over a very large dataset have been
           noted using buckets.

           Note that this doesn't hold for when there are less distinct
           values of the variable than buckets (for example, in boolean
           variables).  However, they will still be put in buckets as
           point 2 below still holds.

       2.  They speed up the training, by allowing the weights array to
           be traversed in-order.  Without buckets, the examples are seen
           in order of the value of the variable, and thus the weights
           array is accessed in a random order.  For a very large dataset,
           the weights array does not fit in cache, which leads to a
           main memory access for each of the examples for each split
           point for each variable.  When buckets are used, the weights
           array is traversed in-order, and can thus be streamed from
           memory (using prefetching, etc as appropriate).  For very
           large datasets, speedups of 5-10x have been noted.
                  
           The n buckets are created by dividing the range of the given
           variable into n disjoint regions.  The boundary values between
           the bucket numbers are kept.

           The algorithm for choosing the disjoint regions tries to put the
           same number of examples into each bucket if possible, so that
           regions of the range where there are lots of examples tend to have
           buckets closer together, and outliers tend to be clustered together
           (rather than be in buckets all by themselves).
