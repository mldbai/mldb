    checked out repo should share the same name. This constraint can easily be
    met by using the filename as the name of the fixture.

    The purpose of this fixture is to create a file sandbox for each tests. This
    sandbox ensures that any created files will not be visible to any other
    running tests and that the test never has to do any cleanup. This is even
    true if the process crashes due to signals.
